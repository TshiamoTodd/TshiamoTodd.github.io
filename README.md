# Welcome to my Official GitHub page, Here you'll find all of my projects
# This however is a little introduction into what it is that I actually do and I am.

My name is Tshiamo Todd Mokwena, I am from Sunny South Africa, Pretoria Gauteng, born and raised.
I am a free spirited individual who enjoys the outdoors and immersing myself in the outside world,
I draw most of my inspiration from nature and anything Green and Enviromental surely gives me goosebumps.
Apart from nature I love Programming, my love for programming started at a very young age, when I was still
in high school back in 2014. I started my Programming journey tinkering with our family PC in my spare time 
building small HTML and javascript programs that did'nt do much at the time, but were enought to impress my friends 
and family.

I certainly enjoy learning new progamming languages and implementing new concepts with those particular
languages.

7 Years later I'm well versed in many languages including those that I started with, amongst them is, C#, C++, Asembler, Java, PHP
GO, Relay Ladder Logic.

Again welcome to my world. I hope you enjoy what I have compiled.
